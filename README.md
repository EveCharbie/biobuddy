`BioBuddy` is an open-source tool for [translating](#model-translation), [creating](#model-creation) and [personalizing](#model-personalization) musculoskeletal models across different formats (e.g., .osim, .bioMod). By enabling reliable interoperability between modeling environments, BioBuddy allows researchers to focus on scientific questions rather than technical constraints.

# How to install 
Currently, the only way to install `BioBuddy` is from source. But it will be available on conda-forge and pip in the near future.

If you are a user, you can set up your environment with minimal dependencies.
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge python=3.11.11 pip
pip install scipy==1.15.1 numpy lxml ezc3d
```
Note: On mac, you might need to add `conda install conda-forge::libcxx`

However, if you are a developer and want to contribute, you will need to set up your environment using the following command:
Due to the OpenSim dependency used only in BioBuddy's tests, we recommend using python=3.11.
```bash
pip install pytest pytest-cov codecov
conda install -c opensim-org opensim=4.5.1
conda install -c conda-forge biorbd=1.11.2 deepdiff
```

# Model translation
You can load the original model using one of the `BiomechanicalModelReal().from_[format]` methods, and then export it 
into another format using the `BiomechanicalModelReal.to_[format]` method (see [example](examples/read_and_write_models.py)).
```python3
from biobuddy import BiomechanicalModelReal

# Read an .osim file
model = BiomechanicalModelReal().from_osim(
    filepath=osim_filepath,
    # Other optional parameters here
)

# Translate it into a .bioMod file
model.to_biomod(biomod_filepath)
```

# Model creation
A model can also be created from scratch using the `BiomechanicalModel`. In this generic model, everything can be defined 
through functions (i.e., without numerical values). The subject specific model (a `BiomechanicalModelReal`) can then be 
generated by evaluating the generic model with a motion capture trial. This feature is especially useful for kinematic 
models where the joint centers are defined based on anatomical marker placement (like in the plug in gait, see full 
[example](examples/create_model_from_c3d.py)). 

Here is a simple example of how to add components to such a model:
```python3

# Create the model
model = BiomechanicalModel()
de_leva = DeLevaTable(total_mass=60, sex=Sex.FEMALE)

# Add components to build the kinematic chain
model.add_segment(
    Segment(
        name="HEAD",
        parent_name="TRUNK",
        segment_coordinate_system=SegmentCoordinateSystem(
            "BOTTOM_HEAD",
            first_axis=Axis(name=Axis.Name.Z, start="BOTTOM_HEAD", end="HEAD_Z"),
            second_axis=Axis(name=Axis.Name.X, start="BOTTOM_HEAD", end="HEAD_XZ"),
            axis_to_keep=Axis.Name.Z,
        ),
        mesh=Mesh(("BOTTOM_HEAD", "TOP_HEAD", "HEAD_Z", "HEAD_XZ", "BOTTOM_HEAD")),
        inertia_parameters=de_leva[SegmentName.HEAD],
    )
)
model.segments["HEAD"].add_marker(Marker("BOTTOM_HEAD"))
model.segments["HEAD"].add_marker(Marker("TOP_HEAD"))
model.segments["HEAD"].add_marker(Marker("HEAD_Z"))
model.segments["HEAD"].add_marker(Marker("HEAD_XZ"))

# Evaluate the model with a motion capture trial
model_real = model.to_real(C3dData(c3d_filepath))
```

There are many different components available to build a model (see this [example](examples/create_model.py) to see how to add those components to your model).

# Model personalization
The current version of BioBuddy allows you to modify your `BiomechanicalModelReal` to personalize it to your subjects by:
- [Scaling](###scaling)
- [Identifying joint centers](###joint-center-identification)

### Scaling:
The scaling is performed by the `ScaleTool` which can be initialized from scratch like this:
```python3
original_model = BiomechanicalModelReal()

# Create the scaling configuration
scaling_configuration = ScaleTool(original_model)

# Add a scaling segment for the pelvis
scaling_configuration.add_scaling_segment(
    SegmentScaling(
        name="pelvis",
        scaling_type= SegmentWiseScaling(
            axis=Translations.XYZ,
            marker_pairs=[
                ["RASIS", "LASIS"],
                ["RPSIS", "LPSIS"],
            ]
        )
    )
)

# Add marker weights for the pelvis segment
scaling_configuration.add_marker_weight(MarkerWeight(name="RASIS", weight=1.0))
scaling_configuration.add_marker_weight(MarkerWeight(name="LASIS", weight=1.0))
scaling_configuration.add_marker_weight(MarkerWeight(name="RPSIS", weight=0.5))
scaling_configuration.add_marker_weight(MarkerWeight(name="LPSIS", weight=0.5))
```
or by reading from an existing file (e.g., `.xml` or `.biomod`) using the appropriate `ScaleTool.from_[format]` method.
Once the scaling configuration is set up, you can scale your model based on a static trial (`.c3d` file) and the total 
mass of your participant using the `ScaleTool.scale` like this:
```python3
# Performing the scaling based on a static trial
scale_tool = ScaleTool.from_biomod(biomod_filepath)
scaled_model = scale_tool.scale(static_c3d=C3dData(filepath), mass=mass)
```

For now, there are three scaling methods available:
- `BodyWiseScaling`: scales the entire body based on the total height of the participant.
- `SegmentWiseScaling`: scales the segment based on the distance between marker pairs.
- `AxisWiseScaling`: scales each axis of the segment independently based on the distance between marker pairs.
![scaling_types](docs/images/Scaling_with_names.png)

### Joint center identification:
The `JointCenterTool` allows you to identify the joint centers of your model based on the movement of segments during 
functional trials.
First, you need to define the joint center configuration using `JointCenterTool.add()` method to define the joint 
you want to modify.
Then, you can use the `JointCenterTool.replace_joint_centers()` method to modify each joint.
```python3
from biobuddy import JointCenterTool

# Set up the joint center identification tool
joint_center_tool = JointCenterTool(scaled_model)
# Example for the right hip
joint_center_tool.add(
    Score(
        functional_c3d=C3dData(c3d_filepath, first_frame=100, last_frame=900),
        parent_name="pelvis",
        child_name="femur_r",
        parent_marker_names=["RASIS", "LASIS", "LPSIS", "RPSIS"],
        child_marker_names=["RGT", "RUB_Leg", "RUF_Leg", "FBF_Leg", "RMFE", "RLFE"],
    )
)
# Example for the right knee
joint_center_tool.add(
    Sara(
        functional_c3d=C3dData(c3d_filepath),
        parent_name="femur_r",
        child_name="tibia_r",
        parent_marker_names=["RGT", "RUB_Leg", "RUF_Leg", "FBF_Leg"],
        child_marker_names=["RATT", "RUB_Tib", "RDF_Tib", "RDB_Tib", "RSPH", "RLM"],
    )
)

# Perform the joint center identification
modified_model = joint_center_tool.replace_joint_centers()
```
For now, two algorithms were implemented `SCoRE` to locate the position of the joint center and `SARA` 
to identify the joint axis of rotation. Please note that in both cases, all segment components stay the same, only the 
joint position and axis are modified.
