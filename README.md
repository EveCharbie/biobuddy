`BioBuddy` is an open-source tool for translating and personalizing musculoskeletal models across different formats (e.g., .osim, .bioMod). By enabling reliable interoperability between modeling environments, BioBuddy allows researchers to focus on scientific questions rather than technical constraints.

# How to install 
Currently, the only way to install BioBuddy is from source. But it will be available on conda-forge and pip in the near future.
